# Decisions

Decisions not fully covered by `PLAN.md`. Newest first.

## 2026-09-26 — Composer autoloader ships in the release zip
PSR-4 autoloading comes from Composer. The release script runs
`composer install --no-dev --classmap-authoritative`, so the zip carries only `vendor/autoload.php`
and the generated classmap (no third-party runtime code). If `vendor/autoload.php` is missing
(e.g. a fresh git checkout without `composer install`), the plugin shows an admin notice and stays
inert instead of fataling.

## 2026-09-26 — Prototype data migration
The prototype stored settings in `convocept_settings` and a "last edited" timestamp in the private
comment meta key `_convocept_edited`. The option name is kept. Migration `1` renames the meta key to
`convocept_edited_at` (the name in PLAN.md §5.4) and drops prototype-only settings
(`live_updates`, `poll_interval`, `load_styles`) while keeping `enabled` and `edit_window`.

## 2026-09-26 — Rebuild ships as 2.0.0
The approved prototype is 1.0.0 on WordPress.org. The rebuild changes the front end, templates and
settings completely, so it is a major version. Releases: 2.0.0 (core + Disqus import),
2.1.0 (remaining importers, onboarding), 2.2.0 (reactions, polling, Abilities, basic AI).

## 2026-09-26 — Disqus importer in core, not a separate add-on
Importer code has zero front-end cost (autoloaded, wired only in wp-admin and WP-CLI), adds no
dependencies (XMLReader is built in), and lets onboarding offer the import at the moment a site
owner is deciding to switch. A separate plugin would need its own WordPress.org review and
release cycle. Guard: a test asserts no `Convocept\Import\*` class loads on a front-end request.

## 2026-09-26 — Basic AI checks free (owner's own provider), advanced AI paid
Free core (2.2.0) may run a basic spam/toxicity check through the core WordPress AI Client when the
site owner has configured a provider. It is opt-in, feature-detected and disclosed in the readme
(external service). Paid add-ons sell advanced AI: custom rules, moderation dashboard,
AI-drafted replies, summaries, and hosted AI that needs no key.
Needs owner confirmation before implementation (WordPress.org guideline impact).
